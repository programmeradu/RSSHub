# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables RSSHub deployment on Netlify Functions, adapting the existing Node.js server application to work within Netlify's serverless function environment. The implementation will leverage RSSHub's existing Vercel serverless compatibility while addressing Netlify-specific requirements and constraints.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy RSSHub to Netlify Functions, so that I can leverage Netlify's hosting platform and edge network for RSS feed generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL generate Netlify-compatible function files
2. WHEN a request is made to any RSS route THEN the system SHALL respond with valid RSS/JSON feeds
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize within Netlify's function timeout limits
4. WHEN environment variables are configured THEN the system SHALL use them for route-specific configurations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Netlify deployment to support all existing RSSHub routes, so that I don't lose functionality when migrating from other platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any existing route is accessed THEN the system SHALL return the same response as the standard deployment
2. WHEN dynamic route imports are needed THEN the system SHALL load routes efficiently within serverless constraints
3. WHEN middleware processing occurs THEN the system SHALL apply all necessary transformations (caching, headers, etc.)
4. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL provide the same OpenAPI functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging in the Netlify environment, so that I can debug issues and monitor performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
2. WHEN logging is enabled THEN the system SHALL output logs compatible with Netlify's logging system
3. WHEN function timeouts approach THEN the system SHALL handle graceful degradation
4. WHEN cold starts occur THEN the system SHALL minimize initialization time

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure caching strategies for Netlify deployment, so that I can optimize performance and reduce function execution time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN caching is configured THEN the system SHALL use Netlify-compatible caching mechanisms
2. WHEN Redis is not available THEN the system SHALL fall back to memory caching or disable caching gracefully
3. WHEN cache headers are set THEN the system SHALL leverage Netlify's CDN caching capabilities
4. WHEN cache expiration occurs THEN the system SHALL regenerate content appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a build process that creates optimized Netlify Functions, so that deployment is automated and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build command runs THEN the system SHALL generate a netlify/functions directory with function files
2. WHEN dependencies are bundled THEN the system SHALL include only necessary modules to minimize function size
3. WHEN configuration files are processed THEN the system SHALL create appropriate netlify.toml settings
4. WHEN the build completes THEN the system SHALL be ready for Netlify deployment without manual intervention

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper handling of Netlify's function constraints, so that the application works reliably within platform limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN function execution time approaches limits THEN the system SHALL complete requests within Netlify's timeout constraints
2. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL operate within Netlify's memory limits
3. WHEN concurrent requests occur THEN the system SHALL handle them appropriately within Netlify's concurrency model
4. WHEN function cold starts happen THEN the system SHALL initialize efficiently to minimize response time
